<!-- ## Blockchain, < 150 words, 1st person

I’m currently the Head of Education alongside the wonderful Gillian Chu. In my previous life, I was most widely known for leading the Blockchain Fundamentals edX initiative. I have also spoken as a guest lecturer for the Blockchain Fundamentals DeCal on UC Berkeley campus a number of times, as well as led talks and workshops internationally on various technical blockchain topics. Before joining Education, I dabbled in multiple externally facing consulting and R&D projects. My primary interests are in distributed and parallel computing, systems design, and science communication. Outside of B@B, you can find me at any of the various cafes around Berkeley enjoying a pour over coffee and dreaming about blockchains, multicloud, and other big networked systems.
