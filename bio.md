# Bios

A collection of bios of varying lengths, focuses, and styles. Keeping them here for reference and copy pasta purposes. Bios are hard to write :((( so most of them are variants of each other.

Rustie currently leads the Education Department and is most well known for spearheading the BerkeleyX Blockchain Fundamentals Professional Certificate MOOC program on edX, reaching 85,000 students from 192 countries around the world. He has also lectured for the Blockchain Fundamentals course offered on UC Berkeley campus, as well as delivered technical talks and workshops internationally. Prior to finding his calling in education, Rustie also helped to develop blockchain PoCs on Ethereum for startups and Fortune 500 companies. Rustie is currently studying classical consensus mechanisms and distributed hash tables for internal research projects. Rustie’s primary interests are in distributed and parallel computing, especially in the design of blockchains, multi cloud, and other big networked systems.

## Parallel Computing Research, < 150 words, 3rd person

Rustie is a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley with a particular interest in distributed and parallel systems. He has experience designing and implementing various distributed algorithms, including for particle simulation, shotgun sequencing, and for cross-platform distributed suffix arrays. He will be joining research staff at Lawrence-Berkeley Lab to develop a runtime system that can transparently aggregate fine-grained operations within a node and send them in one bulk message to take advantage of bandwidth.

## Engineering, < 150 words, 3rd person

Rustie is a third year undergraduate at UC Berkeley with extensive experience in software development. At Amazon, Rustie built a fully integrated AWS general purpose scheduling service and supporting application from the top down, used by HR to cut costs by over 90%. In the ASUC Office of the CTO, Rustie drove adoption of Bitrise continuous integration, spearheaded the development of a new caching system for new internal service oriented architecture after advocating for migration, and led development efforts in both Android and Systems teams on the Berkeley Mobile open source project. Rustie will be joining WANdisco R&D team in Summer 2019 and Facebook's Production Engineering team in Fall 2019.

<!-- ## Blockchain, < 150 words, 1st person

I’m currently the Head of Education alongside the wonderful Gillian Chu. In my previous life, I was most widely known for leading the Blockchain Fundamentals edX initiative. I have also spoken as a guest lecturer for the Blockchain Fundamentals DeCal on UC Berkeley campus a number of times, as well as led talks and workshops internationally on various technical blockchain topics. Before joining Education, I dabbled in multiple externally facing consulting and R&D projects. My primary interests are in distributed and parallel computing, systems design, and science communication. Outside of B@B, you can find me at any of the various cafes around Berkeley enjoying a pour over coffee and dreaming about blockchains, multicloud, and other big networked systems.
