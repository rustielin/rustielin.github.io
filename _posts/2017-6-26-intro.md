Hello!

This is the first of hopefully many posts on my blog, which I plan to create new content for periodically.

For the first blog post, what better topic than the blog itself! This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator
used to create simple yet elegant websites. Jekyll lets me write blog posts in markdown and converts these markdown files
into a complete, static website, which is then served by GitHub Pages.

I'm currently using the [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
themes for Jekyll. Credits to the authors of these amazing themes! Definitely check out the links to the projects above.

One of the awesome out-of-the-box features Lanyon comes with is code syntax highlighting. I'm sure I'll be taking advantage
of this functionality in the future, sharing interesting code snippets I write or find online. As a programmer and
computer scientist, it's obligatory for me to...

{% highlight java %}
public class Hello{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    System.out.println("Hope you enjoy the blog!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks!

Rustie
