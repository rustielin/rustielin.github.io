The brief period of unemployment between graduation and the starting date at my first full-time job out of college is basically purgatory. Especially with the graduation ceremony only happening in the Spring following my graduation, it feels even more so. There are many loose ends, with research, club involvement, and connections being the biggest contributors to my continual connection with campus. But as the dust settles in this chaotic phase of my life, I can only slowly realize that the last few years of my life have only been to set the default of my continual success in both personal and professional matters.

### Academia vs Industry (aka the pursuit of impact)

I struggled to narrow down my true interests in terms of career path. It's definitely a very naive and perhaps privileged way of thinking -- that one can make a meaningful, positive impact. Those are just words, and while it's possible, it's important to think of goals in varying levels of granularity. Of course impact might be the eventual goal, but there are smaller and more immediate ways to achieve impact that may be collinear in trajectory. 

Somewhere along the line, perhaps idolization of professors and other academics, I found myself .

Especially in the blockchain space I had so suddenly found myself immersed in, the community is stratified by product/technology, founders of which often times reach demi-god-like status.
