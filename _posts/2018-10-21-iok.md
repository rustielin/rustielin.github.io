I've been working on an interactive blockchain education depdency graph. Historically has been called an "Index of Knowledge." Features now:
* Highlight all dependencies 
* Cycle detection
* Only has modules from edX courses

Goal would be to have more granularity and breadth of topics, and for each node, contain:
* Pop up textbox with brief description (from textbook)
* Curated links to learn more

More to come following course redesign.
