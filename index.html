    <p> Hello World! </p>

    <p> My name is Rustie, and I'm a second year Computer Science undergraduate at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in mobile and blockchain technologies.</p>

	<p> Currently, I'm involved in the blockchain space as an education officer and edX team lead for Blockchain at Berkeley. I'm responsible for bringing quality Berkeley blockchain education to the masses. I have also delivered lectures both campus-wide and internationally: on topics such as Bitcoin mechanics, distributed systems, and alternative consensus. In addition, I am actively involved in official campus software projects commissioned by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), where I am a lead Android developer. Combining my experiences with education, blockchain, and mobile, I wish to make the benefits of cutting-edge technology more accessible. </p>


    <p> On this website, I'll be hosting some projects, a small blog about anything that I find interesting, my resume, and some contact info if you want to reach out to me. </p>
    <p> I'm actively seeking new challenges and opportunities! (Especially Summer 2018 internships).
      If you're a recruiter, be sure to check out my links and contact info above.</p>

    <p>Thanks,</p>
    <p>Rustie</p>

  Edit: I've been working on launching an edX course for Blockchain Fundamentals, and along with it, a rewriting of the textbook
  to reflect more up-to-date information. For any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:edx@blockchain.berkeley.edu">edx@blockchain.berkeley.edu</a>
